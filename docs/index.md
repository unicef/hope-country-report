# Country Report

Hope Country Report (HCR) is a pivotal component within the Hope platform, specifically designed to empower UNICEF country offices with the ability to generate customized reports tailored to their unique requirements. These reports are not mere static compilations of data, but rather dynamic representations of information extracted from the Hope Database.

At the core of this data retrieval process lies the utilization of Python and Django code. These programming languages provide the necessary tools to extract and manipulate data from the database, enabling the creation of reports that are both informative and visually appealing.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the available data within the Hope Database, it is essential to refer to the GitHub repository.
