# Tutorial

HOPE users can create reports by retrieving data from the HOPE database.

At the core of this data retrieval process lies the utilization of [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) and [**Django**](https://www.djangoproject.com/) code. These programming languages provide the necessary tools to extract and manipulate data from the database, enabling the creation of reports that are both informative and visually appealing.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the available data within the Hope Database, it is essential to refer to the GitHub repository at this [link](https://github.com/unicef/hope-country-report/blob/develop/src/hope_country_report/apps/hope/models/_inspect.py) .
